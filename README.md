## Hello in this repo where I will shere my journey learning rust.

#### You can read the same book I am reading by running `rustup docs --book` in your terminal.

#### Each directory representes a chapter or a part from a chapter.

#### I am learning rust to get some kind of deep knowlage of programming and I want to use it along with clap to create some CLIs to automate my workflow as well as building some extenstions for python as we all know "PYTHON IS VERY VERY VERY SLOW".

#### After I finish this I will read the "rust by practice" repo and solve all problems there.


#### After learning rust and build some projects in web scraping and after I build some CLIs for my work I will have to get some deep dive into SQL (with postgres) and linux (along with bash) then I will move to learn deep things about django's ORM and django rest framework along with Ninja or FastAPI (I want to learn ninga but if I found that it have the same performace as django rest framework I will learn FastAPI).

#### After all of this (this might take about 6 months or more) I will begin in JavaScript with expressjs or I might begin in css then bootstrap then just become a full stack django / react developer (taking a decision in this situation is really hard).

#### So yeah I have lots of things to learn and I will keep going until I learn all of this.


#### Update (21-10-2023): I found this youtube tutorial which is great I mean that I will learn from a video and I won't have to look and read the whole book which is really great.
